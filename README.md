### 🏥 Project Overview
This repository implements the **Federated Personalized Drift-Aware Attention Framework (FPDAF)**, a decentralized deep learning architecture designed for **early Sepsis prediction and patient deterioration forecasting** in Intensive Care Units (ICUs).

By exploiting time-series clinical signals, the framework addresses three main challenges:
* **The Privacy Gap**: Collaborative training across hospital nodes without sharing raw patient records, conforming to HIPAA/DPDPA regulations.
* **The Accuracy Gap**: Personalization using localized classification heads to adapt to hospital-specific patient demographics.
* **The Trust Gap**: Dual-level clinical explainability incorporating sequential multi-head attention weights and SHAP explanations.

## Dataset
* **Source**: [PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/)
* **Hospitals**: 2 Hospital Systems (`training_setA` and `training_setB`)
* **Patients**: 40,327 total (20,336 Hospital A, 19,991 Hospital B)
* **Format**: Pipe-separated values (`.psv`) recorded hourly containing 40 clinical variables + `SepsisLabel` target.
* **Storage**: Local dataset files are placed in `datasets/raw/` and excluded from Git tracking. See [DATASET_SETUP.md](DATASET_SETUP.md) for details.

## Quick Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/23CSE-TEAM-28/23CSE498-Project-Phase-II.git
   cd 23CSE498-Project-Phase-II
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Setup raw data**: Refer to [DATASET_SETUP.md](DATASET_SETUP.md) for instructions on downloading and placing the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

```text
Raw Dataset (.psv) ──> Imputation (FFill/BFill) ──> Scaling (StandardScaler) ──> Sliding Windows (24h) ──> PyTorch Tensors (.pt)
```

* **Imputation**: Sequence-based patient-level imputation (Forward Fill $\rightarrow$ Backward Fill $\rightarrow$ Zero-padding).
* **Leakage-Free Scaling**: `StandardScaler` fitted strictly on the training partition and saved to `scaler.pkl`.
* **Sliding Window Segmenting**: Reshapes time-series features into sequence blocks of 24 hours.
* **Short-Stay Padding**: ICU patient stays less than 24 hours are pre-padded with zeros at sequence starts.
* **Patient Isolation**: Partitioned at patient-level into disjoint sets (70% train, 15% val, 15% test) to prevent leakage.
* **Validation Check**: Preprocessing verified using an independent quality audit script generating visual and PDF verification reports.

## 🏥 Clinical ICU Decision Support System Dashboard (FPDAF Demo)

To showcase the unified sepsis forecasting pipeline, we provide a modern Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) Dashboard. It is split into a **FastAPI backend** (which runs live PyTorch model inference on test sequences, un-scales physiological metrics, and processes real-time CUSUM scores) and a **React+TypeScript frontend** (configured with Tailwind CSS v4, Recharts, and Framer Motion).

### ⚙️ Installation & Running

#### 1. Start the FastAPI Backend
Ensure you are in the root directory:
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
*API docs will be available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).*

#### 2. Start the React Frontend Dashboard
Navigate to the `dashboard/` subdirectory:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```
*The ICU CDSS application will be active at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).*
